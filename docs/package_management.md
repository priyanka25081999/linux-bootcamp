* **Package Management in Linux:**
    
      
  1. One of the most important function of any linux distribution is package management. Originally, most linux distributions like slackware were simply collections of tarball - 
     that is archives of either binaries or sources which needed to be compiled in order to install various applications and other system services etc.
  2. However, this method has many disadvantages:
  
       1. Removing all files from a package can be difficult.
       2. A developer may lose a track of what exact sources were used to build a particular binary packages.
       3. One might accidentally delete a package that other packages need or install a package that will not work because it needs other packages that have not been installed.
       4. Updates and upgrades can be very difficult for a number of reasons. If you do upgrade while the system is running, you can get all sorts of critical problems, even a crash. The order of upgrading packages might also be important.
